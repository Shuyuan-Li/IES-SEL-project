"# IES-SEL-project" 
The repository includes selected scripts I wrote for the IES-SEL project mentioned above, including:
•	Script to prepare the data: a1_sback_2122_gen_input_sets
•	Scripts to generate overall and group-specific regression results from various models: b1_sbac_2122_reg, b2_sbac_2122_reg_groups, and b3_sbac_2122_reg_groups_models
•	Scripts to generate graphs for better presentation of regression results: c1_sbac_2122_graph, c2_sbac_2122_graph_groups
The IES-SEL project comprises ten studies. The code provided is for a specific research study that examines the role of SEL in mitigating learning loss during COVID-interrupted years and assessing whether they are particularly beneficial for historically marginalized students. As the lead researcher of this study, I am responsible for data processing, conducting analyses, and drafting the paper. I am currently working on the draft.
